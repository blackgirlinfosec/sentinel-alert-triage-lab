Incident Title:
Detect PowerShell Download Activity (Invoke-WebRequest)

Incident ID:
142636

Analyst:
Fee Bolden

Date Investigated:
May 26, 2025

Severity:
High

Status:
Open (pending escalation)

Entities Involved:
- User: [Redacted]
- Host: [Redacted]
- Process: powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

Summary:
A high-severity alert was generated by Microsoft Sentinel due to the use of PowerShell with download-related functions such as Invoke-WebRequest. The command was executed with an ExecutionPolicy Bypass flag, which is commonly used to evade script execution restrictions.

The activity has been mapped to the following MITRE ATT&CK tactics:
- Execution (T1059.001 – PowerShell)
- Command and Control (T1071.001 – Web Protocols)

Contextual Findings:
Entity Behavior review revealed:
- 29 security alerts associated with this user account over the past 48 hours.
- A recent "Impossible Travel" detection from Microsoft Sentinel.
- A password reset performed by an administrator shortly after the incident occurred.

The Investigation Graph confirms the alert's linkage to the user, the host machine, and the executing process.

Triage Assessment:
This alert appears to be a True Positive. The use of PowerShell to download remote content, combined with behavioral anomalies and high alert volume, suggests the possibility of malicious activity. The context supports that this is not an isolated false positive.

Recommended Actions:
- Escalate to Tier 2 or Incident Response for deeper investigation.
- Pull full sign-in and process logs from the affected host for the past 72 hours.
- Investigate possible persistence mechanisms or lateral movement from the user account.
- Consider containment (isolation) of the host if further signs of compromise emerge.

Next Steps:
- Analyst awaiting Tier 2 review
- Update case after endpoint investigation and user interview (if applicable)
